# Office Detective

> "Every spreadsheet tells a story. Most are boring. Yours isn't."

---

## 🎯 Vision

**Office Detective** is a web-based investigation game where you play as a freelance forensic auditor hired by companies to solve corporate mysteries: fraud, embezzlement, data leaks, and sabotage. Dig through emails, invoices, chat logs, and financial records to connect the dots, identify the culprit, and deliver your report — all in 15-30 minute cases with a dark humor twist.

## 🎮 The Player Fantasy

You are **the person companies call when things don't add up**. Not the police — they're too slow and too public. You're the discreet professional who reads between the lines of expense reports and finds the skeleton in the supply chain.

## ✨ Unique Selling Points

1. **AI-powered assistant with mandatory citations** — The in-game AI helper can't lie or hallucinate; every claim links to a specific document
2. **Interactive evidence board** — Visualize connections between people, money, and documents
3. **Procedurally generated cases** — High replayability with template-based variation
4. **Personalized cases** — Customize company names, characters, and tone for shareable humor
5. **Bite-sized investigations** — Complete cases in 15-30 minutes
6. **Dark corporate humor** — Relatable absurdity of office life (Knives Out meets The Office)
