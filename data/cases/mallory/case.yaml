# Client briefing
briefing: |
  Good morning. Thank you for taking this case on such short notice.

  I'm Diana Walsh, VP of Finance at TechFlow Industries. We're a mid-sized
  software company — nothing flashy, but we've been growing steadily for
  the past few years.

  Here's the situation: during our Q1 close, I noticed some... irregularities
  in our vendor payments. Specifically, there's a company called "Sunshine
  Supplies Ltd." that we've been paying for "strategic consulting services."
  The amounts aren't huge — around $45,000 total over three months — but
  here's the thing: nobody seems to know what they actually do for us.

  I asked around. Marketing hasn't worked with them. Engineering hasn't
  either. The only paper trail leads back to our Procurement department,
  specifically to Marcus Chen, our Procurement Manager. He says it's all
  above board, but something feels off.

  Before I involve legal or HR, I need to know what's really going on.
  That's where you come in. I've compiled a dossier of relevant documents —
  emails, invoices, vendor records. Everything you should need.

  Find out if there's something here, or if I'm just being paranoid. Either
  way, I need answers.

    - entity_id: P1 # Marcus Chen

  mechanism: |
    Marcus Chen created a shell company called "Sunshine Supplies Ltd." at his
    girlfriend's residential address (123 Oak Street). As Procurement Manager,
    he had authority to both register new vendors and approve invoices up to
    $15,000. He submitted fake invoices for vague "consulting services" that
    were never provided, approved them himself, and collected payments totaling
    $45,750 over three months.
