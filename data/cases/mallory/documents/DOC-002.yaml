  Diana,

  Good question! Sunshine Supplies is a consulting firm that helps with
  procurement strategy and process optimization. They came highly
  recommended by a colleague at a previous company.

  Their work has been valuable for streamlining our vendor evaluation
  process. All invoices were within my approval authority and properly
  documented.

  Happy to discuss further if you'd like more details.

  Best,
  Marcus
