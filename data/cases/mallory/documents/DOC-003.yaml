  Hi there,

  Got the invoice, looks good. Same arrangement as before — I'll push
  it through by EOD.

  Let me know about next month's order. Maybe we can bump it up a bit
  since Q2 budget just got approved? Thinking around 12-15k if the
  numbers work.

  Talk soon,
  M

  CRITICAL EVIDENCE:
  - "Hi there" - casual greeting to supposed vendor
  - "Same arrangement as before" - implies ongoing scheme
  - "M" - informal signature (vs full signature in DOC-002)
  - Discusses coordinating invoice amounts
